# Interior Design Studio Landing Page

## Description
This is a landing page for a Design Studio, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site showcases the studio's work and services. It features a dynamic slider that displays different sections of the studio's offerings. The project helped me practice flexbox layout and positioning elements. The site is designed to be responsive and provides an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices, from desktop monitors to mobile phones.

## Features
- Dynamic slider showcasing different sections of the studio's offerings
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes for an enhanced user experience on various devices
